    This data has not been peer reviewed and has inaccuracies. For details of the methodology, refer to <a href="http://jeremynagel.blogspot.com.au/2016/11/analysis-of-australian-government_29.html">the blog post detailing the data collection process</a><br>
    Below are some of the known limitations:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>In some cases states use significant federal funding. This was classified under federal funding rather than state funding for the NT. However, in other states (e.g. NSW), the breakdown was not specified so some state funding data will be inaccurate.</li>
      <li>Infrastructure funding was generally not identified separately in budget papers. Instead most states reported it under the relevant department (e.g. transport or business). In some cases, there were standalone line items for infrastructure but this does not represent the full spending</li>
      <li>Transport data could not be cleanly divided into Roads/Public transport as some state governments did not provide granular reporting</li>
      <li>Spending classification was a subjective process as I was unable to find consistent categorisation in the budget papers. Often this proved tricky - e.g. should the State Library of NSW fall under education or recreation and culture? (I chose recreation and culture in this case)</li>
    </ul>
